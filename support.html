  <p style="padding-left:10px; padding-right:10px;">Additionally, if you are a local business, consider becoming a Season Sponsor. You can choose to be a Presenting Sponsor or a Program Ad Sponsor. As a Presenting Sponsor, you will help to support one major show on our Loft Stage or Black Box Theater. These sponsorships receive the most visibility, both connected to the showâ€™s pre-publicity and on-site visibility, as well as on an annual basis on our website and in other donor recognition communications. Being a Program Ad Sponsor is a very affordable way to support community arts while also receiving visibility among our local audience members, who appreciate businesses that invest in quality arts programming in our neighborhoods! Place an ad in our well-read show programs! For more information, please contact info@wct.org.</p>
